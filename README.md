### CracklePop

#### Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Crackle instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Pop. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print CracklePop. You can use any language.

My Ruby solution to a CracklePop (FizzBuzz-like) test, in `cracklepop.rb`. File is currently set up to print 1 to 100 when running it directly: `ruby cracklepop.rb`

TDD spec file also written to accompany this test, in `/spec/cracklepop_spec.rb`.
Run `rspec spec` to see results of the tests.
